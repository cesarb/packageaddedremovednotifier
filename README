Package Added/Removed Notifier

This small Android utility alerts you via a status bar notification
whenever a package is installed, updated, or removed. It also logs all
these events, and allows you to view the log later.

The code is written to run on Android 1.6 or newer; however, the
notification icons for Android older than 3.0 are missing, so the
minimum API level has been set to 11. If icons are provided for API
level 9 (res/drawable-*dpi-v9/) and API level 4 (res/drawable-*dpi/), it
should work fine on these older devices (currently untested).

To compile this code, you need to put android-support-v4.jar (found in
the Support Package) in the libs/ directory.
